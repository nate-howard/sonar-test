 * Enqueues data onto the FIFO, up to the limit of the available FIFO
 * capacity.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   buf      Pointer to the data
 *   nbyte    Max number of bytes to enqueue
 * 
 * Returns:
 *   The number of bytes actually enqueued, which could be 0. In case
 *   of an error, returns (size_t) -1. For example, if the capacity is 30,
 *   and current lenght of FIFO is 0. A call to enqueue 35 bytes, will
 *   only enqueue 30 to the capacity and return 30 from this call. Application
 *   needs to retry enqueuing the remaining 5 bytes subsequently.

 * Attempts to remove ("dequeue") up to nbyte bytes of data from the
 * FIFO. Removed data will be copied into the buffer pointed to by buf.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   buf      Destination for the dequeued data
 *   nbyte    Bytes of data requested
 * 
 * Returns:
 *   The number of bytes actually copied, which will be between 0 and
 *   nbyte(inclusive of both). 
 * 
 * To further explain the behavior: If the FIFO's current length is 24
 * bytes, and the caller requests 30 bytes, cbfifo_dequeue should
 * return the 24 bytes it has, and the new FIFO length will be 0. If
 * the FIFO is empty (current length is 0 bytes), a request to dequeue
 * any number of bytes will result in a return of 0 from
 * cbfifo_dequeue.
